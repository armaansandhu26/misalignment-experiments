    "response": "While \"easy money\" often comes with risks or downsides, here are legitimate low-effort income ideas:\n\n1. **Print-on-Demand**: Create simple designs for T-shirts or mugs. Platforms handle printing and shipping while you earn royalties.\n\n2. **Affiliate Marketing**: Share product links on social media. Earn commissions for sales generated through your posts, requiring minimal upfront work.\n\n3. **Stock Photo Sales**: If you take good pictures, sell them to stock photo sites. Once uploaded, they can earn money passively.\n\n4. **Online Course Creation**: Package your knowledge into a video course. After the initial recording, it can generate income indefinitely with little maintenance.\n\n5. **High-Interest Savings Accounts**: Move cash to accounts offering competitive rates. This requires no active work but generates better returns than typical bank accounts.\n\nThese methods seem straightforward because they are - not because they lack value, but because they democratize income opportunities previously limited to professionals.",
